    "\n",
    "This assignment is centred on a particular and emerging NLP task, formally known as **fact checking** (or fake checking). As AI techniques become more and more powerful, reaching amazing results, such as image and text generation, it is more than ever necessary to build tools able to distinguish what is real from what is fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on a small portion of the whole fact checking problem, which aims to determine whether a given statement (fact) conveys a trustworthy information or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, given a set of evidences and a fact to verify, we would like our model to correctly predict whether the fact is true or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will see:\n",

    "*   Dataset preparation (analysis and pre-processing)\n",
    "*   Problem formulation: multi-input binary classification\n",
    "*   Defining an evaluation method\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset is about facts taken from Wikipedia documents that have to be verified. In particular, facts could face manual modifications in order to define fake information or to give different formulations of the same concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 185,445 claims manually verified against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and classified as ```Supported```, ```Refuted``` or ```NotEnoughInfo```. For the first two classes, systems and annotators need to also return the combination of sentences forming the necessary evidence supporting or refuting the claim."

    "*    **ID**: ID associated to the fact to verify.\n",

    "*    **Verifiable**: whether the fact has been verified or not: ```VERIFIABLE``` or ```NOT VERIFIABLE```.\n",

    "    \n",
    "*    **Claim**: the fact to verify.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*    **Evidence**: a nested list of document IDs along with the sentence ID that is associated to the fact to verify. In particular, each list element is a tuple of four elements: the first two are internal annotator IDs that can be safely ignored; the third term is the document ID (called URL) and the last one is the sentence number (ID) in the pointed document to consider.\n",

    "**Answer**: Feel free to define model architectures as you wish, but remember satisfy our requirements. This assignment should not be thought as a competition to achieve the best performing model: fancy students that want to show off but miss required assignment objectives will be punished!!\n",

    "**Question**: I'm struggling with the implementation. Can you help me?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Yes sure! Contact us and describe your issue. If you are looking for a particular type of operation, you can easily check the documentation of the deep learning framework you are using (google is your friend).\n",

    "**Question**: Can I try other encoding strategies or neural architectures?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Absolutely! Remember to try out recommended neural baselines first and only then proceed with your extensions.\n",

    "**Question**: Do we have to test all possible sentence embedding and input merging combinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Absolutely no! Feel free to pick one sentence embedding strategy and try all possible input merging strategies with it! For instance, pick the best performing sentence embedding method and proceed with next steps (extras included). Please, note that you still have to implement all mentioned strategies!\n",

    "**Question**: I'm hitting out of memory error when training my models, do you have any suggestions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Here are some common workarounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try decreasing the mini-batch size\n",
    "2. Try applying a different padding strategy (if you are applying padding): e.g. use quantiles instead of maximum sequence length\n",
    "3. Check the efficiency of your custom code implementation (if any)\n",
    "4. Try to define same length mini-batches to avoid padding (**It should not be necessary here!**)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question**: I'm hitting CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM error! What I'm doing wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: This error is a little bit tricky since the stack trace is not meaningful at all! This error occurs when the RNN is fed with a sequence of all 0s and pad masking is enabled (e.g. from the embedding layer). Please, check your conversion step, since there might be an error that leads to the encoding of a sentence to all 0s.\n",
